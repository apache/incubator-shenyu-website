This document introduces how to quickly access the ShenYu Gateway using Http. You can get the code example of this document by clicking [here](https://github.com/dromara/shenyu/tree/master/shenyu-examples/shenyu-examples-http).

## Environment to prepare

Please refer to the [setup](../shenyu-set-up) and launch `shenyu-admin` and `shenyu-bootstrap`.

Introducing gateway to HTTP proxy plugin

* Add the following dependencies to the `shenyu-bootstrap`'s `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<!--if you use http proxy start this-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.shenyu</groupId>
    <artifactId>shenyu-spring-boot-starter-plugin-divide</artifactId>
    <version>${last.version}</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.shenyu</groupId>
    <artifactId>shenyu-spring-boot-starter-plugin-httpclient</artifactId>
    <version>${last.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Run the shenyu-examples-http project

Download[shenyu-examples-http](https://github.com/dromara/shenyu/tree/master/shenyu-examples/shenyu-examples-http)

Execute the `org.dromara.shenyu.examples.http.ShenyuTestHttpApplication` main method to start project.

The following log appears when the startup is successful:
```shell

```

## Enable the Divide plugin to handle HTTP requests

* enabled the `divide` plugin in the `shenyu-admin` plugin management.

## Testing http request

The `shenyu-examples-http` project will automatically register interface methods annotated with `@ShenyuSpringMvcClient` in the shenyu gateway after successful startup.

Open Plugin Management -> divide to see the list of plugin rule configurations
