## how to use apache email

When you become a committer, you will have an apache email. This tutorial uses apache email based on `gmail`. Don't ask why it's `gmail`, I've stepped through the hole......

**1、Build a VPN**

* for macos：https://github.com/yanue/V2rayU/releases

* for windows：https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases

* import VPN nodes：https://github.com/freefq/free

**2、Find an available VPN node (recommended to use the US one)**

**3、login to gmail**

* [gmail official website](https://gmail.google.com) is here;

* If you haven't registered before, register a gmail email and log in;

* If you have registered before, log in directly.

**4、set up your apache email**

1. click on settings

2. find your apache email

You should have an email from `root@apache.org` like this in your mailbox:
* Titled `Welcome to the Apache Software Foundation`
* The content is as follows
    ```text
    Dear YYYY,

    Good news! We have created your Apache Software Foundation (ASF) committer account, and it is now ready for you.

    Your ApacheID is: xxxx
  
    ......
    ```
* Apparently your Apache email is `xxxx@apache.org`

3. add apache email
