**4. PPMC Member Responsibilities**

The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) helps the podling learn how to manage the community. It works similarly to the PMC, but reports to the IPMC rather than the ASF Board. The PPMC is directly responsible for overseeing the incubation program, and it also determines the nominations of PPMC members.

## Summary Incubation Program Reports

The IPMC writes reports from each incubation program and sends them to the ASF Board. Watch the dev mailing list and the general@incubator.apache.org mailing list for reminder.

## Developing New Submitters

Developing committers is one of the most important functions of any PMC, including the incubation project, and PMC members need to guide contributors to contribute smoothly, monitor their contribution volume, and nominate contributors as committers when appropriate.

## Participate in community activities

This includes but is not limited to answering questions, giving talks, promoting projects, maintaining the brand, etc.

## Release and version checking

PPMC members should actively become release managers to release new releases. If you are not a release manager, you should do release checking when a new release is under publishing.
